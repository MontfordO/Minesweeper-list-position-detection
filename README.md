This code has limited user input. It creates a 2D minesweeper grid using list variables. It then fills the empty spots with the relevant numbers, like the minesweeper game
Using a for loop with a nested for loop, the grid is created using a random range to locate the mines
The list is then iterated through. When a # (mine) is detected, the adjacent spots are added to
